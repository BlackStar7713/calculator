        The calculator has many math functions. For example sin, cos, abs, log and etc..
        \nThe format of a functions is - \'function_name(arg1, arg2, &#8230;, arg_n)\'.
        \nYou can use any of the functions listed below. A wrong name or a wrong number of parameters will throw an error.
        \nThe calculator is case-sensitive, so \'SiN\' and \'sin\' are actually different words (the latter is a function, but the former is not)
